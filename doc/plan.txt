Dee for Python3
===============

Python 3 syntax (compatible with 2.6 if possible)

Use new {} set literals
Use code inspection to remove need for extra [] heading on extend/update
All Relations to be (implicitly if necessary) part of an outer Database
Database catalog implemented via Dee
Constraints held at database level
Plugin structure for Database persistence
Extensive unit testing and coverage

Perhaps layers on top: SQL, Django, SQLAlchemy etc? perhaps via DB-API
Perhaps DB-API is the persistence plugin method too?
